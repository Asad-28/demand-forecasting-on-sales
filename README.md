# Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning

This Jupyter notebook (`Demand_Forecasting.ipynb`) demonstrates a basic demand forecasting model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict sales based on features such as month and day of the week. The notebook uses Python and popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and seaborn.

## Introduction

Demand forecasting is a critical task for businesses to optimize their operations and inventory management. This notebook provides a machine learning approach to predict sales using features like month and day of the week.

## Installation

To run this notebook locally, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is loaded from a CSV file (`train.csv`). It contains information about sales and dates.

## Exploration

The initial exploration of the dataset involves loading it, examining the first few rows, and converting the date column to the datetime format. Further, features like month and day of the week are extracted.

## Preprocessing

The features (`month` and `day_of_week`) and the target variable (`sales`) are defined. Additionally, a pipeline with feature scaling and multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) is created.

## Model Selection

The notebook uses k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each model. The model with the lowest average Mean Squared Error (MSE) across folds is selected as the best model.

## Evaluation

The chosen model is evaluated on the entire dataset, and additional metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared are calculated.

## Visualization

The notebook concludes with a visualization comparing actual sales with predicted sales for the best model.

## Conclusion

The README provides an overview of the demand forecasting project, explaining the purpose, installation, dataset, exploration, preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and visualization steps.
